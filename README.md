# Flowmodoro Timer

This is a simple timer application built with Elm that implements the [Flowtime Technique](https://medium.com/@UrgentPigeon/the-flowtime-technique-7685101bd191).

The Flowtime Technique is a productivity method that combines the principles of the Pomodoro Technique with a more flexible approach to work sessions. It allows you to work in focused blocks of time while also incorporating breaks, helping to maintain flow and reduce burnout.
